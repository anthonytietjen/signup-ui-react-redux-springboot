# Client

## Description

The client is a React app using `create-react-app`.

The pages and components use the Presentational and Container Component pattern to separate logic from view code.

## Shortcuts taken
1. Did not set up eslint.
1. Using JavaScript. Could switch to TypeScript based on project goals.
1. Not using PropTypes. Could specify the PropTypes or switch to TypeScript and use IProps interfaces.
1. Using CSS. Could use Sass or a CSS-in-JS solution based on the project goals.
1. Not using Code Splitting. Could add code splitting based on project size and goals.
1. Very basic CSS used. Could add something like Bootstrap, invent own styles, etc, based on project needs.
1. Not using responsive CSS. Could add media queries to make the CSS responsive.
